    <p>Jesus <strong>fucking </strong>christ, honestly, it's
    took me fucking ages, just to get a heading underneath
this picture, what the fuck?!? I still don't understand
why I have to wrap it in a paragraph just to get around
the formatting, can someone help me understand please?!</p>

<p>Pizza looks nice though, errmm.. Just make some dough,
    sprinkle some shit on top. Oven for 20 mins. Gas Mark 6.
